            <p>River is a 7 year old bichon frise. Though he is aging, he is extremely active and loves to play. 
                He likes to throw things. He will throw his ball down the stairs and play fetch with himself if you don’t
                 give him attention. He will also throw his food and water bowl to let us know he wants more. </p>
                 
            <p> River is obsessed with my mom. My mom is the one who mostly walks him and gives him treats. 
                Anywhere my mom goes, River follows. If she's gone for 2 minutes, he will frantically search the house 
                for her. Although he likes being with people, he hates being cuddled or held. </p>
